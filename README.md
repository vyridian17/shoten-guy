No wallets were harmed in the making of this demo ecommerce portal.

I'm building this as a study with:

- MERN stack
- Redux
- JWT
- a bevy of fun libraries
- ...and we'll see as I go along.

Setup:

Your .env file will contain:
```md
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=<<mongo db connect string>>
```

`npm i` in both root and front-end

`npm run dev` from root
